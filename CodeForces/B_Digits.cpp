/*
This program checks which of the numbers {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} divide a number N,
where N consists of a single digit 'd' repeated n! (n factorial) times.

Key ideas:
- A number made of digit 'd' repeated k times has digit sum d * k.
- For large n, n! quickly grows very large, but divisibility patterns stabilize for n >= 7.

Divisibility checks:
1. 1: All numbers are divisible by 1.
2. 3: Number is divisible by 3 if d * k is divisible by 3.
3. 5: Number is divisible by 5 if d is 0 or 5.
4. 7: Known mathematical propertyâ€”
      If n >= 3, the repeated-digit number will always be divisible by 7 due to cyclic patterns in base 10.
      Otherwise, check if d is divisible by 7.
5. 9: Number is divisible by 9 if d * k is divisible by 9.

Practical optimization:
Since the result is stable for n >= 7, we set n = min(n, 7).
Compute k = n!, and use it only for rules that require it.

The function then prints all divisors that pass the test for the given (n, d).
