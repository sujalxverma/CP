ðŸ§  What This Code Teaches (Conceptually)

1. Two-pointers / Binary Search on Sorted Array:
   - The approach follows the "fix one, search the rest" pattern.
   - For each fixed element a[i], we use binary search to efficiently find
     how many a[j] (where j > i) satisfy a given condition.

2. Efficient Pair Counting:
   - A brute-force solution to count valid (i, j) pairs would take O(n^2) time.
   - By leveraging the sorted array and binary search (upper_bound),
     we reduce the inner loop to O(log n), resulting in an overall time
     complexity of O(n log n).

3. Use of upper_bound:
   - upper_bound returns an iterator to the first element greater than a given value.
   - This makes it perfect for range-based queries, especially when working
     with sorted arrays.

4. Index Math and Iterator Arithmetic:
   - Carefully converting iterators to indices and adjusting bounds is
     critical when using STL functions like upper_bound.
   - Getting these details right is an essential skill in C++ competitive programming.
